## Some Deep Learning 4 Financial Crime Experiments
Deep Learning is probably not used enough in financial crime. This repo hosts some code and experiments which should hopefully help someone to get to running experiments quickly on financial data such as credit card transactions or payments.

The examples use PyTorch as DeepLearning framework. PyTorch is a fantastic framework, but it does have someone what of a learning curve. In-depth knowlegde of PyTorch is not needed to run the examples. They will start high level, try to abstract some of the details, but allow some-one who is interested to dig into the nitty gritty network definitions.
