## Notebook 01_single section
Examples of 2 dimensional input.
- [01_classifiers](https://github.com/t0kk35/d373c7/tree/master/notebooks/01_single/01_classifiers). Basic classifier examples, these show how to train a model to predict a label (fraud vs non-fraud)
- [02_encoders](https://github.com/t0kk35/d373c7/tree/master/notebooks/01_single/02_encoders). Encoders show how a Neural Net can be used to reconstruct the input, the more difficult and less accurate the Neural Net reconstructs the input, the more *abnormal* it is. Encoders can be used for basic anomaly detection.
- [03_multi_head](https://github.com/t0kk35/d373c7/tree/master/notebooks/01_single/03_multi_head). Neural Nets can work on multiple logical data-streams/data-sources for instance a transaction stream and a customer referential data stream. The multi-head examples demonstrate how to set these up.
- [04_transfer_learning](https://github.com/t0kk35/d373c7/tree/master/notebooks/01_single/04_transfer_learning). TBD
