## Notebook 02_series/01_stacked section
This section of the notebooks has examples of stacked series. Stacked series are basically just lists of payment with their features. It will become clear that the Rank 3 tensors allow different and more complicate

- 01_classifiers: [01_classifiers](https://github.com/t0kk35/d373c7/tree/master/notebooks/02_series/01_stacked/01_classifiers): Has examples of how stacked series can be used to predict a classifier (Fraud vs. Non-Fraud)   
- 02_encoders: [02_encoders](https://github.com/t0kk35/d373c7/tree/master/notebooks/02_series/01_stacked/02_encoders): Will show that we can use encoders to reconstruct entire series.
- 03_ntp: [03_ntp](https://github.com/t0kk35/d373c7/tree/master/notebooks/02_series/01_stacked/03_ntp): Next Transaction Prediction. This is a new objective. Here we ask the neural net to tell us what it thinks the next transaction will look like.
