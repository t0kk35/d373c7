## Notebook section
This section contains example notebooks. The notebooks are divided into subdirectories.
- The first set of examples in [01_single](https://github.com/t0kk35/d373c7/tree/master/notebooks/01_single) show some simple examples with one dimensional/single input. E.g. process single transactions through a Neural Net. The input has rank-2, it's basically a 2-dimensional Excel spreadsheet like input. With the training records being the rows and the columns the various features. It's what we would typically think of when using AI for financial crime detection. The shape of the training input is `(Batch x Features)`
- The second set of examples in [02_series](https://github.com/t0kk35/d373c7/tree/master/notebooks/02_series) show examples of processing higher dimensional/series input.  For instance a set of transactions through a Neural Net. These are the more complex and novel use-cases, where the input can be of rank-3, typically the records being the first dimension, then the second dimension being time or a list and the features being the 3rd dimension. The shape of the training input is `(Batch x [series] x Features)`
